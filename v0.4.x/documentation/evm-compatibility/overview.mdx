Cosmos EVM provides **full Ethereum compatibility** for Cosmos-SDK based chains. All standard / common Ethereum dApps, tools, and workflows work seamlessly while gaining the benefits of Cosmos consensus and interoperability.

<Info>
All the tools and workflows you rely on work exactly as they should. Deploy contracts seamlessly, connect with MetaMask, and build with Web3.js/Ethers, Hardhat, Remix, Foundry—the full Ethereum toolkit.

## Critical EVM Compatibility Features

<Info>
**Full Ethereum Compatibility:** Cosmos EVM maintains all critical EVM behaviors that developers expect. The table below shows how we've addressed each compatibility requirement.
</Info>

| Feature | Ethereum Behavior | Cosmos EVM Implementation |  Compatible? |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| **Transaction Ordering** | Gas price + nonce ordering | Fee priority + nonce ordering |  Yes |
| **Multiple Txs per Block** | Multiple per account | Multiple per account |  Yes |
| **Mempool Behavior** | Pending pool for transactions | Standard mempool (experimental 2-tier available) |  Yes |
| **Nonce Management** | Sequential nonce enforcement | Sequential nonce enforcement |  Yes |
| **EIP-1559 (Dynamic Fees)** | Base fee + priority fee | Base fee + priority fee (distributed, not burned) |  Yes |
| **Address Format** | 0x addresses | 0x addresses (+ cosmos1 alias) |  Yes |
| **Smart Contracts** | EVM bytecode execution | Full EVM bytecode execution |  Yes |
| **Gas Metering** | Standard gas costs | Standard gas costs |  Yes |
| **Event Logs** | Ethereum event system | Full event compatibility |  Yes |
| **JSON-RPC API** | Standard Ethereum RPC | Full RPC implementation |  Yes |
| **Block Time** | 12 seconds | 1-2 seconds |  Faster |
| **Finality** | 12+ blocks (~3min) | 1 block (~2s) |  Instant |
| **Reorganizations** | Possible | Not possible |  More secure |
| **Cross-chain** | Bridge protocols | Native IBC |  Enhanced |

### What This Means for Developers

**You can build on Cosmos EVM exactly like you would on Ethereum.** Every essential feature works identically - from deploying contracts to managing transactions. The enhancements (faster blocks, instant finality, IBC) are pure additions that don't break any existing patterns or workflows.

## Architectural Improvements Over Ethereum

### Faster & Final Transactions

**Instant Finality:** Transactions are final after one block (~2 seconds) thanks to Tendermint BFT consensus. No waiting for confirmations, no reorganizations possible.

**Validator Set:** Fixed validator set with stake-based voting power. Requires 2/3+ stake agreement for consensus.

### Gas & Fees

<Info>
**Base Fee Distribution:** Unlike Ethereum where base fees are burned, Cosmos EVM distributes them to validators, preserving token economics.
</Info>

- **EIP-1559 Support:** Dynamic base fee adjustments based on block utilization
- **Configurable:** Base fee can be disabled (`NoBaseFee` parameter)
- **Priority Calculation:** `min(gas_tip_cap, gas_fee_cap - base_fee)`
- **Minimum Gas Price:** Chain-wide floor price configuration

### Address System

Every account has two representations:
```
Ethereum: 0x742d35cc6644c068532fddb11B4C36A58D6D3eAb
Cosmos:   cosmos1wskntvnryr5qxpe4tv5k64rhc6kx6ma4dxjmav
```

Both formats reference the same account - use either based on your needs.

### Chain ID Architecture

<Warning>
**Two Independent Chain IDs:** Cosmos EVM uses separate chain IDs for different purposes:
- **Cosmos Chain ID:** String format (e.g., "cosmosevm-1") for consensus/IBC
- **EVM Chain ID:** Integer format (e.g., 9000) for MetaMask/contracts

These are completely independent values, not derived from each other.
</Warning>

## Precompiled Contracts

### Key Precompile Addresses

| Function | Address |
|----------|---------|
| **Staking** | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000800` |
| **Distribution** | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000801` |
| **IBC Transfer** | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000802` |
| **Bank** | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000804` |
| **Governance** | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000805` |

## JSON-RPC API

<Card title="Ethereum RPC Compatibility" icon="code" href="/v0.4.x/api-reference/ethereum-json-rpc/methods">
  Most standard Ethereum JSON-RPC methods are supported, with some returning stub values for compatibility. View the complete reference.
</Card>

**Core functionality your dApp needs:**
-  Essential transaction methods (`eth_sendRawTransaction`, `eth_call`, `eth_estimateGas`)
-  Block and receipt queries (fully functional)
-  Account balances and nonces
-  Event logs and filters (basic support)
-  Web3 utilities and net info
-  Debug namespace (partial - tracing and profiling methods available)
-  Subscription support (WebSocket)

**Implementation notes:**
- Some methods return stub values for compatibility (e.g., `eth_gasPrice` returns 0)
- Mining-related methods are not applicable (Cosmos uses Tendermint consensus)
- `txpool` methods require experimental mempool configuration
- Debug namespace includes functional tracing and profiling tools

## EIP Support

  Interactive table showing support status for all 339+ Ethereum Improvement Proposals.
</Card>

### Notable Differences

- **EIP-1559:** Base fee distributed to validators instead of burned
- **EIP-155:** Replay protection enforced at chain level
- **Custom Improvement Proposals (CIPs):** Chain-specific optimizations available

## Developer Experience

### Everything You Know Still Works

**Your Ethereum skills and tools work unchanged:**
- Deploy contracts with Hardhat, Foundry, or Remix
- Connect MetaMask and other Web3 wallets
- Use Web3.js, Ethers.js, Viem, or any Web3 library
- All ERC standards work (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, etc.)
- Solidity and Vyper compile and run identically
- Standard tooling like OpenZeppelin contracts work perfectly

### Additional Benefits You Get

**Enhanced capabilities without breaking compatibility:**
- **Instant Finality:** No waiting for confirmations - transactions are final in ~2 seconds
- **No Reorganizations:** Events and state changes are immediately permanent
- **Native IBC:** Built-in cross-chain communication to any Cosmos chain
- **Lower Costs:** Typically much lower gas fees than Ethereum mainnet
- **Dual Address Access:** Same account reachable via both 0x and cosmos1 formats

### Transaction Pool

**Standard Ethereum mempool behavior is fully supported.** Transactions are ordered by gas price and nonce, multiple transactions per account per block work perfectly.

<Info>
**Optional Enhancement:** An experimental two-tiered mempool is available that adds intelligent nonce gap handling and automatic transaction promotion. This is purely optional - the standard mempool works exactly like Ethereum.
</Info>

## Migration from Ethermint/Evmos

Key breaking changes when migrating:

1. **Chain ID Format:** Cannot use Ethermint format (`evmos_9001-2`). Must configure two separate IDs.
2. **Module Names:** `x/evm` → `x/vm`
3. **Parameter Types:** Several parameter type changes (e.g., MinGasPrice: string → sdk.Dec)
4. **Precompile Addresses:** Different addresses than Ethermint

## Security & Reliability

**Battle-tested and audited:**
-  **Security Audited:** Full audit by Sherlock (July 2025)
-  **Production Ready:** Core EVM implementation is stable and deployed on multiple mainnets
-  **Enhanced Security:** No reorganization attacks possible due to instant finality
-  **Byzantine Fault Tolerant:** Requires 2/3+ validator stake for any state changes
-  **Proven Stack:** Built on Cosmos SDK and Tendermint, powering hundreds of chains
