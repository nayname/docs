<Note>
  A Protobuf `Msg` service processes [messages](/v0.50/build/building-modules/messages-and-queries#messages). Protobuf `Msg` services are specific to the module in which they are defined, and only process messages defined within the said module. They are called from `BaseApp` during [`DeliverTx`](/v0.50/learn/advanced/baseapp#delivertx).

## Implementation of a module `Msg` service[​](#implementation-of-a-module-msg-service "Direct link to implementation-of-a-module-msg-service")

Each module should define a Protobuf `Msg` service, which will be responsible for processing requests (implementing `sdk.Msg`) and returning responses.

As further described in [ADR 031](/v0.50/build/architecture/adr-031-msg-service), this approach has the advantage of clearly specifying return types and generating server and client code.

Protobuf generates a `MsgServer` interface based on a definition of `Msg` service. It is the role of the module developer to implement this interface, by implementing the state transition logic that should happen upon receival of each `sdk.Msg`. As an example, here is the generated `MsgServer` interface for `x/bank`, which exposes two `sdk.Msg`s:

x/bank/types/tx.pb.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.0-alpha.0/x/bank/types/tx.pb.go#L550-L568)

When possible, the existing module's [`Keeper`](/v0.50/build/building-modules/keeper) should implement `MsgServer`, otherwise a `msgServer` struct that embeds the `Keeper` can be created, typically in `./keeper/msg_server.go`:

x/bank/keeper/msg\_server.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.0-alpha.0/x/bank/keeper/msg_server.go#L17-L19)

`msgServer` methods can retrieve the `context.Context` from the `context.Context` parameter method using the `sdk.UnwrapSDKContext`:

x/bank/keeper/msg\_server.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.0-alpha.0/x/bank/keeper/msg_server.go#L56)

`sdk.Msg` processing usually follows these 3 steps:

### Validation[​](#validation "Direct link to Validation")

The message server must perform all validation required (both *stateful* and *stateless*) to make sure the `message` is valid. The `signer` is charged for the gas cost of this validation.

For example, a `msgServer` method for a `transfer` message should check that the sending account has enough funds to actually perform the transfer.

It is recommended to implement all validation checks in a separate function that passes state values as arguments. This implementation simplifies testing. As expected, expensive validation functions charge additional gas. Example:

```
ValidateMsgA(msg MsgA, now Time, gm GasMeter) error {    if now.Before(msg.Expire) {        return sdkerrrors.ErrInvalidRequest.Wrap("msg expired")    }    gm.ConsumeGas(1000, "signature verification")    return signatureVerificaton(msg.Prover, msg.Data)}
```

<Warning>
  Previously, the `ValidateBasic` method was used to perform simple and stateless validation checks. This way of validating is deprecated, this means the `msgServer` must perform all validation checks.
</Warning>

### State Transition[​](#state-transition "Direct link to State Transition")

After the validation is successful, the `msgServer` method uses the [`keeper`](/v0.50/build/building-modules/keeper) functions to access the state and perform a state transition.

### Events[​](#events "Direct link to Events")

Before returning, `msgServer` methods generally emit one or more [events](/v0.50/learn/advanced/events) by using the `EventManager` held in the `ctx`. Use the new `EmitTypedEvent` function that uses protobuf-based event types:

```
ctx.EventManager().EmitTypedEvent(    &group.EventABC{Key1: Value1,  Key2, Value2})
```

or the older `EmitEvent` function:

```
ctx.EventManager().EmitEvent(    sdk.NewEvent(        eventType,  // e.g. sdk.EventTypeMessage for a message, types.CustomEventType for a custom event defined in the module        sdk.NewAttribute(key1, value1),        sdk.NewAttribute(key2, value2),    ),)
```

These events are relayed back to the underlying consensus engine and can be used by service providers to implement services around the application. Click [here](/v0.50/learn/advanced/events) to learn more about events.

The invoked `msgServer` method returns a `proto.Message` response and an `error`. These return values are then wrapped into an `*sdk.Result` or an `error` using `sdk.WrapServiceResult(ctx context.Context, res proto.Message, err error)`:

baseapp/msg\_service\_router.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.0-alpha.0/baseapp/msg_service_router.go#L160)

This method takes care of marshaling the `res` parameter to protobuf and attaching any events on the `ctx.EventManager()` to the `sdk.Result`.

proto/cosmos/base/abci/v1beta1/abci.proto

```
loading...
```

This diagram shows a typical structure of a Protobuf `Msg` service, and how the message propagates through the module.

## Telemetry[​](#telemetry "Direct link to Telemetry")

New [telemetry metrics](/v0.50/learn/advanced/telemetry) can be created from `msgServer` methods when handling messages.

This is an example from the `x/auth/vesting` module:

x/auth/vesting/msg\_server.go

```
loading...
```
