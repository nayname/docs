## Abstract[​](#abstract "Direct link to Abstract")

Often in the SDK, we would like to run certain code every-so often. The purpose of `epochs` module is to allow other modules to set that they would like to be signaled once every period. So another module can specify it wants to execute code once a week, starting at UTC-time = x. `epochs` creates a generalized epoch interface to other modules so that they can easily be signaled upon such events.

## Concepts[​](#concepts "Direct link to Concepts")

The epochs module defines on-chain timers that execute at fixed time intervals. Other SDK modules can then register logic to be executed at the timer ticks. We refer to the period in between two timer ticks as an "epoch".

Every timer has a unique identifier. Every epoch will have a start time, and an end time, where `end time = start time + timer interval`. On mainnet, we only utilize one identifier, with a time interval of `one day`.

The timer will tick at the first block whose block time is greater than the timer end time, and set the start as the prior timer end time. (Notably, it's not set to the block time!) This means that if the chain has been down for a while, you will get one timer tick per block, until the timer has caught up.

## State[​](#state "Direct link to State")

The Epochs module keeps a single `EpochInfo` per identifier. This contains the current state of the timer with the corresponding identifier. Its fields are modified at every timer tick. EpochInfos are initialized as part of genesis initialization or upgrade logic, and are only modified on begin blockers.

## Events[​](#events "Direct link to Events")

The `epochs` module emits the following events:

### BeginBlocker[​](#beginblocker "Direct link to BeginBlocker")

| Type         | Attribute Key | Attribute Value  |
| ------------ | ------------- | ---------------- |
| epoch\_start | epoch\_number | \{epoch\_number} |
| epoch\_start | start\_time   | \{start\_time}   |

### EndBlocker[​](#endblocker "Direct link to EndBlocker")

| Type       | Attribute Key | Attribute Value  |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| epoch\_end | epoch\_number | \{epoch\_number} |

## Keepers[​](#keepers "Direct link to Keepers")

### Keeper functions[​](#keeper-functions "Direct link to Keeper functions")

Epochs keeper module provides utility functions to manage epochs.

## Hooks[​](#hooks "Direct link to Hooks")

```
  // the first block whose timestamp is after the duration is counted as the end of the epoch  AfterEpochEnd(ctx sdk.Context, epochIdentifier string, epochNumber int64)  // new epoch is next block of epoch end block  BeforeEpochStart(ctx sdk.Context, epochIdentifier string, epochNumber int64)
```

### How modules receive hooks[​](#how-modules-receive-hooks "Direct link to How modules receive hooks")

On hook receiver function of other modules, they need to filter `epochIdentifier` and only do executions for only specific epochIdentifier. Filtering epochIdentifier could be in `Params` of other modules so that they can be modified by governance.

This is the standard dev UX of this:

```
func (k MyModuleKeeper) AfterEpochEnd(ctx sdk.Context, epochIdentifier string, epochNumber int64) {    params := k.GetParams(ctx)    if epochIdentifier == params.DistrEpochIdentifier {    // my logic  }}
```

### Panic isolation[​](#panic-isolation "Direct link to Panic isolation")

If a given epoch hook panics, its state update is reverted, but we keep proceeding through the remaining hooks. This allows more advanced epoch logic to be used, without concern over state machine halting, or halting subsequent modules.

This does mean that if there is behavior you expect from a prior epoch hook, and that epoch hook reverted, your hook may also have an issue. So do keep in mind "what if a prior hook didn't get executed" in the safety checks you consider for a new epoch hook.

## Queries[​](#queries "Direct link to Queries")

The Epochs module provides the following queries to check the module's state.

```
service Query {  // EpochInfos provide running epochInfos  rpc EpochInfos(QueryEpochsInfoRequest) returns (QueryEpochsInfoResponse) {}  // CurrentEpoch provide current epoch of specified identifier  rpc CurrentEpoch(QueryCurrentEpochRequest) returns (QueryCurrentEpochResponse) {}}
```

### Epoch Infos[​](#epoch-infos "Direct link to Epoch Infos")

Query the currently running epochInfos

```
<appd> query epochs epoch-infos
```

:::details Example

An example output:

```
epochs:- current_epoch: "183"  current_epoch_start_height: "2438409"  current_epoch_start_time: "2021-12-18T17:16:09.898160996Z"  duration: 86400s  epoch_counting_started: true  identifier: day  start_time: "2021-06-18T17:00:00Z"- current_epoch: "26"  current_epoch_start_height: "2424854"  current_epoch_start_time: "2021-12-17T17:02:07.229632445Z"  duration: 604800s  epoch_counting_started: true  identifier: week  start_time: "2021-06-18T17:00:00Z"
```

:::

### Current Epoch[​](#current-epoch "Direct link to Current Epoch")

Query the current epoch by the specified identifier

```
<appd> query epochs current-epoch [identifier]
```

:::details Example

Query the current `day` epoch:

```
<appd> query epochs current-epoch day
```

Which in this example outputs:

```
current_epoch: "183"
```
