<Note>
  `BeginBlocker` and `EndBlocker` are optional methods module developers can implement in their module. They will be triggered at the beginning and at the end of each block respectively, when the [`BeginBlock`](/v0.47/learn/advanced/baseapp#beginblock) and [`EndBlock`](/v0.47/learn/advanced/baseapp#endblock) ABCI messages are received from the underlying consensus engine.

## BeginBlocker and EndBlocker[​](#beginblocker-and-endblocker-1 "Direct link to BeginBlocker and EndBlocker")

`BeginBlocker` and `EndBlocker` are a way for module developers to add automatic execution of logic to their module. This is a powerful tool that should be used carefully, as complex automatic functions can slow down or even halt the chain.

When needed, `BeginBlocker` and `EndBlocker` are implemented as part of the [`BeginBlockAppModule` and `BeginBlockAppModule` interfaces](/v0.47/build/building-modules/module-manager#appmodule). This means either can be left-out if not required. The `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock` methods of the interface implemented in `module.go` generally defer to `BeginBlocker` and `EndBlocker` methods respectively, which are usually implemented in `abci.go`.

The actual implementation of `BeginBlocker` and `EndBlocker` in `abci.go` are very similar to that of a [`Msg` service](/v0.47/build/building-modules/msg-services):

* They generally use the [`keeper`](/v0.47/build/building-modules/keeper) and [`ctx`](/v0.47/learn/advanced/context) to retrieve information about the latest state.
* If needed, they use the `keeper` and `ctx` to trigger state-transitions.
* If needed, they can emit [`events`](/v0.47/learn/advanced/events) via the `ctx`'s `EventManager`.

A specificity of the `EndBlocker` is that it can return validator updates to the underlying consensus engine in the form of an [`[]abci.ValidatorUpdates`](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/spec/abci/abci++_methods#endblock). This is the preferred way to implement custom validator changes.

It is possible for developers to define the order of execution between the `BeginBlocker`/`EndBlocker` functions of each of their application's modules via the module's manager `SetOrderBeginBlocker`/`SetOrderEndBlocker` methods.
