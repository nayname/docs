<Note>
  Modules generally handle a subset of the state and, as such, they need to define the related subset of the genesis file as well as methods to initialize, verify and export it.

## Type Definition[​](#type-definition "Direct link to Type Definition")

The subset of the genesis state defined from a given module is generally defined in a `genesis.proto` file ([more info](/v0.47/learn/advanced/encoding#gogoproto) on how to define protobuf messages). The struct defining the module's subset of the genesis state is usually called `GenesisState` and contains all the module-related values that need to be initialized during the genesis process.

See an example of `GenesisState` protobuf message definition from the `auth` module:

proto/cosmos/auth/v1beta1/genesis.proto

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/proto/cosmos/auth/v1beta1/genesis.proto)

Next we present the main genesis-related methods that need to be implemented by module developers in order for their module to be used in Cosmos SDK applications.

### `DefaultGenesis`[​](#defaultgenesis "Direct link to defaultgenesis")

The `DefaultGenesis()` method is a simple method that calls the constructor function for `GenesisState` with the default value for each parameter. See an example from the `auth` module:

x/auth/module.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/x/auth/module.go#L55-L59)

### `ValidateGenesis`[​](#validategenesis "Direct link to validategenesis")

The `ValidateGenesis(data GenesisState)` method is called to verify that the provided `genesisState` is correct. It should perform validity checks on each of the parameters listed in `GenesisState`. See an example from the `auth` module:

x/auth/types/genesis.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/x/auth/types/genesis.go#L61-L74)

## Other Genesis Methods[​](#other-genesis-methods "Direct link to Other Genesis Methods")

Other than the methods related directly to `GenesisState`, module developers are expected to implement two other methods as part of the [`AppModuleGenesis` interface](/v0.47/build/building-modules/module-manager#appmodulegenesis) (only if the module needs to initialize a subset of state in genesis). These methods are [`InitGenesis`](#initgenesis) and [`ExportGenesis`](#exportgenesis).

### `InitGenesis`[​](#initgenesis "Direct link to initgenesis")

The `InitGenesis` method is executed during [`InitChain`](/v0.47/learn/advanced/baseapp#initchain) when the application is first started. Given a `GenesisState`, it initializes the subset of the state managed by the module by using the module's [`keeper`](/v0.47/build/building-modules/keeper) setter function on each parameter within the `GenesisState`.

The [module manager](/v0.47/build/building-modules/module-manager#manager) of the application is responsible for calling the `InitGenesis` method of each of the application's modules in order. This order is set by the application developer via the manager's `SetOrderGenesisMethod`, which is called in the [application's constructor function](/v0.47/learn/beginner/overview-app#constructor-function).

See an example of `InitGenesis` from the `auth` module:

x/auth/keeper/genesis.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/x/auth/keeper/genesis.go#L8-L35)

### `ExportGenesis`[​](#exportgenesis "Direct link to exportgenesis")

The `ExportGenesis` method is executed whenever an export of the state is made. It takes the latest known version of the subset of the state managed by the module and creates a new `GenesisState` out of it. This is mainly used when the chain needs to be upgraded via a hard fork.

See an example of `ExportGenesis` from the `auth` module.

x/auth/keeper/genesis.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/x/auth/keeper/genesis.go#L37-L49)

### GenesisTxHandler[​](#genesistxhandler "Direct link to GenesisTxHandler")

`GenesisTxHandler` is a way for modules to submit state transitions prior to the first block. This is used by `x/genutil` to submit the genesis transactions for the validators to be added to staking.
