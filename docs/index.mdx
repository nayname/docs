Welcome to the Cosmos knowledge base. This hub is the single entry point and source of truth to every major component of the Cosmos stack.

## Core concepts

- **[Cosmos EVM](./evm/)** – Deploy Solidity smart contracts that inter-operate natively with Cosmos.
- **[IBC Protocol](./ibc/)** – Secure, trust-minimised cross-chain communication.

## Quick‑start guides *(more coming soon)*

* [Deploy your first smart contract](./evm/quickstart)
* [Build a Cosmos app](./sdk/quickstart)
* [Set up an IBC connection](./ibc/quickstart)
