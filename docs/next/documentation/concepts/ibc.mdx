# IBC

> An Overview of the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol

<Info>
  This is a summary view of IBC v2 \[Eureka]. For more comprehensive details, guides and more please visit the official [Eureka documentation](https://docs.skip.build/go/eureka/eureka-overview).
</Info>

### Core Data Structures

The `Packet` is the primary container for cross-chain communication in IBC v2. Each packet may wrap **one or more** application-specific **`Payload`** objects.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript packet.ts
  // Main container sent between chains
  interface Packet {
    sourceClientId: bytes;    // Client ID for destination chain (stored on source)
    destClientId: bytes;      // Client ID for source chain (stored on destination)
    sequence: uint64;         // Monotonically increasing nonce per client-pair
    timeout: uint64;          // UNIX timestamp (seconds) for packet expiry
    data: Payload[];          // Application payload(s)
  }

// Application-specific data
interface Payload {
sourcePort: bytes;  // Sending application identifier
destPort: bytes;    // Receiving application identifier
version: string;    // Application version
encoding: string;   // MIME-type for decoding
value: bytes;       // Opaque app data
}

```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Timeout is measured **against the destination chain’s clock**, not the source. This ensures safety even under clock drift.
</Info>

## Key On-Chain Components

<Accordion title="Client (ICS-02) – Light Client">
A light client verifies the state of a counterparty chain with cryptographic proofs against trusted consensus.

Each IBC client defines a `ClientState` (long-term parameters) and evolving `ConsensusState`s (snapshots). If consensus assumptions are violated, misbehaviour evidence can freeze the client.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Provable Store (ICS-24)">
A Merkle-proof-capable key–value store used for commitments.

| Value             | Path Format                                    |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Packet Commitment | `{sourceClientId}0x1{bigEndianUint64Sequence}` |
| Packet Receipt    | `{destClientId}0x3{bigEndianUint64Sequence}`   |
| Acknowledgement   | `{destClientId}0x2{bigEndianUint64Sequence}`   |

These standardized paths allow counterparties to verify packet existence, receipts, and acknowledgements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Routing & Handler (ICS-25)">
The IBC handler exposes the standard functions for packet relay:
`SendPacket`, `RecvPacket`, `AcknowledgePacket`, and `TimeoutPacket`.

It enforces **exactly-once delivery**, ensures valid ordering (ordered, unordered, or ordered-allow-timeout), and dispatches packets to the correct application.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Port Allocation (ICS-05)">
Applications must bind to unique **`portId`** values during initialization. Ports are referenced in every `Payload` for routing incoming packets.
</Accordion>

## Application Interface (ICS-26)

An IBC-enabled application **must** implement these callbacks to manage the packet lifecycle:

* **`OnRecvPacket(...)`** – Executed on the **destination chain** to process incoming data. Must return an **Acknowledgement**, which may contain success data or an error.
* **`OnAcknowledgePacket(...)`** – Executed on the **source chain** once an acknowledgement is verified. Provides acknowledgement data so the sending application can finalize or revert actions.
* **`OnTimeoutPacket(...)`** – Executed on the **source chain** if a timeout occurs, enabling rollback or refunds.

<Attention>
For packets with multiple payloads, execution is **atomic**. If `OnRecvPacket` fails for even one payload, the **entire packet** is considered failed. All state changes from other successful payloads **must be reverted**.
</Attention>

## Packet Lifecycle

<Accordion title="1. SendPacket (Source Chain)">
Application data is wrapped into a `Packet`, assigned a `sequence`, and committed at the **Packet Commitment** path.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. RecvPacket (Destination Chain)">
Destination chain verifies the packet commitment proof via its light client. Upon success, it stores a **Receipt** at the Packet Receipt path and invokes `OnRecvPacket`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. WriteAcknowledgement (Destination Chain)">
The receiving application returns an `Acknowledgement`. This is committed under the **Acknowledgement** path, allowing proof for the source chain.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. AcknowledgePacket (Source Chain)">
Source chain verifies the acknowledgement proof, deletes the original commitment, and calls `OnAcknowledgePacket` on the sending application.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="5. TimeoutPacket (Source Chain)">
If the `timeout` elapses before a receipt exists on the destination chain, the source verifies this via proof of non-existence, deletes the commitment, and triggers `OnTimeoutPacket`.
</Accordion>

```
