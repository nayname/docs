      <Accordion title="New Chain Launch">
        **Best for:** Greenfield projects, new ecosystems

        **Timeline:** 2-4 months from development to mainnet

        **Process:**
        1. Design tokenomics and governance structure
        2. Configure genesis parameters and validator set
        3. Set up infrastructure (RPC nodes, indexers, block explorers)
        4. Launch testnet and conduct security audits
        5. Coordinate mainnet launch with community

        **Key Decisions:**
        - Chain ID and denomination setup
        - Validator requirements and delegation parameters
        - EVM configuration (gas limits, precompiles)
        - Bridge infrastructure for cross-chain assets
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Existing Chain Upgrade">
        **Best for:** Adding EVM to established Cosmos chains

        **Timeline:** 4-8 months including governance process

        **Process:**
        1. Develop upgrade plan and migration strategy
        2. Test upgrade on staging network
        3. Submit governance proposal with detailed plan
        4. Coordinate validator upgrade process
        5. Execute chain halt and upgrade

        **Critical Considerations:**
        - State migration strategy
