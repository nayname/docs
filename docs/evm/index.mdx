# Cosmos EVM

Cosmos EVM brings the Ethereum Virtual Machine to the Cosmos ecosystem, enabling developers to deploy Solidity smart contracts while leveraging the full power of the Cosmos SDK. This integration provides the best of both worlds: Ethereum's proven development tools and ecosystem alongside Cosmos' sovereignty, interoperability, and performance.

## Architecture Overview

Cosmos EVM consists of several key components that work together to provide seamless Ethereum compatibility:

- **EVM Module**: Core Ethereum Virtual Machine implementation
- **Fee Market Module**: Dynamic gas pricing with EIP-1559 support  
- **ERC20 Module**: Automatic token bridging between Cosmos and EVM
- **Precompiled Contracts**: Direct access to Cosmos SDK functionality
- **JSON-RPC Server**: Standard Ethereum API for wallet and tool integration
