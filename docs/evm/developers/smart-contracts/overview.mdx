# Smart Contract Development Lifecycle

Developing smart contracts is a multi-stage process that requires careful attention to detail, especially regarding security and gas efficiency. This guide outlines the standard, best-practice lifecycle for bringing a smart contract from an idea to a live, verified deployment on a Cosmos EVM chain.

## The 5 Stages of the Development Lifecycle

### Stage 1: Write Code

This is the initial phase where you translate your application's logic into Solidity.

#### **Setup Your Environment**
-   **IDE**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the most popular choice. Install the `hardhat-solidity` extension for syntax highlighting and language support.
-   **Framework**: Choose a development framework to manage your project. The two main choices are:
    -   **[Hardhat (JavaScript/TypeScript)](../tooling-and-resources/hardhat-guide)**: Excellent for developers coming from a web development background.
    -   **[Foundry (Solidity)](../tooling-and-resources/foundry-guide)**: Allows you to write your tests directly in Solidity, which can be more intuitive.

#### **Leverage Standard Libraries**
-   **Don't Reinvent the Wheel**: For common patterns like tokens (ERC20, ERC721), access control (`Ownable`), and security utilities (`ReentrancyGuard`), use a battle-tested library like [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts).
-   **Installation**: Add it to your project with `npm install @openzeppelin/contracts` (for Hardhat) or by managing dependencies in `foundry.toml` (for Foundry).

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

// Import a standard, secure Ownable contract from OpenZeppelin
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MyContract is Ownable {
    // Your custom logic here
    constructor() Ownable(msg.sender) {}
}
```

### Stage 2: Compile

The compilation step converts your human-readable Solidity code into EVM bytecode, which is the machine code that the blockchain can execute.

-   **Compiler Version**: Always specify the exact compiler version using a `pragma` statement (e.g., `pragma solidity 0.8.24;`). This prevents unexpected behavior from different compiler versions.
-   **Framework Commands**: Your chosen framework handles this step for you.
    -   `npx hardhat compile`
    -   `forge build`
-   **Output**: This process generates two key artifacts:
    -   **Bytecode**: The code that will be deployed on-chain.
    -   **ABI (Application Binary Interface)**: A JSON file that describes your contract's functions. Your frontend application (using Ethers.js or Viem) will use the ABI to know how to interact with your deployed contract.

### Stage 3: Test

**This is the most critical stage.** Thorough testing is essential to ensure your contract is secure and functions as expected.

  <Card title="Unit Testing" icon="scale-balanced">
    Tests that check individual functions in isolation to verify their logic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Integration Testing" icon="network-wired">
    Tests that check how multiple contracts (or a contract and a precompile) work together.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fuzz Testing" icon="vial-virus">
    A powerful technique where the testing framework throws thousands of random inputs at your functions to find edge cases you didn't consider. See our [Testing and Fuzzing Guide](../tooling-and-resources/testing-and-fuzzing).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Your framework is also your testing runner:
-   `npx hardhat test`
-   `forge test`

### Stage 4: Deploy

Deployment is the act of sending a transaction that puts your compiled contract bytecode onto the blockchain.

#### **Deployment Scripts**
Create scripts to manage your deployments. This makes the process repeatable and less error-prone. Both Hardhat and Foundry have scripting capabilities.

#### **Network Configuration**
-   **Testnet First**: Always deploy to a public testnet before mainnet. This allows you to do a final round of testing in a live, multi-user environment.
-   **Mainnet**: For mainnet deployment, you will need:
    -   The chain's RPC URL and Chain ID.
    -   A funded account to pay for deployment gas.

#### **Security**
-   **Never commit private keys to Git.** Use `.env` files and a tool like `dotenv` to manage them securely.

```bash
# Example deployment with Hardhat
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network cosmosEvmTestnet
```

### Stage 5: Verify

Verification is the process of publishing your contract's source code and linking it to the deployed bytecode on a block explorer.

-   **Why Verify?**: An unverified contract is a black box. Verification provides transparency and builds trust with your users, as they can read the code and confirm that it does what you claim.
-   **How it Works**: Block explorers have a verification engine. You provide them with your source code and compiler settings. The explorer re-compiles your code and checks if the resulting bytecode matches what's on-chain.
-   **Tools**: Frameworks often have plugins (e.g., `hardhat-etherscan`) that automate this process.

Once verified, your contract's page on the block explorer will show a green checkmark, and users will be able to read and interact with your functions directly from the explorer's UI.
