The `x/ibc` module from [cosmos/evm](https://github.com/cosmos/evm) implements Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol support with specialized EVM callback functionality for cross-chain smart contract interactions.


## Overview

The IBC module extends the standard IBC protocol with EVM-specific features:

- **IBC Callbacks**: Execute EVM contracts automatically during IBC packet lifecycle
- **Cross-chain Contract Calls**: Enable smart contracts to interact across chains
- **Packet Lifecycle Management**: Handle acknowledgments and timeouts through EVM contracts

## Components

### IBC Callbacks

The EVM Callbacks module implements the EVM contractKeeper interface that interacts with ibc-go's [callbacks middleware](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/main/modules/apps/callbacks/README.md), specifically for ICS-20 transfer applications.

**Key Features:**
- **Destination Callbacks**: Execute contracts on packet receipt (`onRecvPacket`)
- **Source Callbacks**: Handle acknowledgments (`onAcknowledgePacket`) and timeouts (`onTimeoutPacket`)
- **Atomic Execution**: Contract calls happen atomically with token transfers

### IBC Transfer Integration

The module works closely with the ICS20 transfer application to enable:
- Cross-chain token transfers to EVM contracts
- Automatic contract execution with received funds
- Custom calldata propagation across chains

<Info>
Smart contracts can initiate IBC transfers using the [ICS20 Precompile](/docs/evm/next/documentation/smart-contracts/precompiles/ics20), which provides the `transfer` function with memo field support for callbacks.
</Info>

<Warning>
**Address Format Limitation**: Currently, IBC transfer receiver addresses must be in bech32 format (e.g., `cosmos1...`). While sender addresses are automatically converted from hex to bech32, receiver addresses must be provided in bech32 format. Full hex address support for receivers is planned for a future release.
</Warning>

## Callback Types

### Destination Callbacks (`onRecvPacket`)

Executed on the destination chain when a packet is received, allowing contracts to:
- Receive cross-chain tokens
- Execute custom logic with the received funds
- Perform operations like DEX swaps or liquidity provision

### Source Callbacks (`onAcknowledgePacket` & `onTimeoutPacket`)

Executed on the source chain when packet lifecycle completes, enabling contracts to:
- Handle successful transfer acknowledgments
- Recover funds from failed/timed out transfers
- Implement retry logic for failed transfers

## Implementation Details

### Memo Format

EVM callbacks use the `memo` field in ICS-20 transfers with specific JSON structure:

**Destination Callback:**
```json
{
  "dest_callback": {
    "address": "0x...",
    "gas_limit": "1000000", 
    "calldata": "0x..."
  }
}
```

**Source Callback:**
```json
{
  "src_callback": {
    "address": "0x...",
    "gas_limit": "1000000"
  }
}
```

### Security Considerations

- **Isolated Addresses**: Destination callbacks use ephemeral addresses to prevent confusion with local accounts
- **Sender Validation**: Source callbacks validate that only the packet sender can set callbacks
- **Gas Limits**: Callback execution is bounded by specified gas limits
