  - {/*
  - Guiding Principles:
  - Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
  - There should be an entry for every single version.
  - The same types of changes should be grouped.
  - Versions and sections should be linkable.
  - The latest version comes first.
  - The release date of each version is displayed.
  - Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.
  - Usage:
  - Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
  - appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry should ideally include a tag and
  - the Github issue reference in the following format:
  - * (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message
  - The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
  - not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.
  - Types of changes (Stanzas):
  - "Features" for new features.
  - "Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
  - "Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
  - "Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
  - "Client Breaking" for breaking CLI commands and REST routes used by end-users.
  - "API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
  - "State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState given the same genesisState and txList.
