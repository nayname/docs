# Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)

The IBC protocol enables secure and reliable communication between independent blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem. Build truly interoperable applications that work across chains.

## What IBC Enables

IBC is a protocol that allows blockchains to communicate with each other in a trustless way:

  <Card title="Token Transfers" icon="arrow-right-left">
    Send and receive tokens between any IBC-enabled chains with cryptographic security guarantees.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Packets" icon="package">
    Pass arbitrary messages and data between chains for complex cross-chain application logic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart Contract Calls" icon="code">
    Execute smart contract functions on remote chains directly from your application or contract.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interchain Accounts" icon="user">
    Control accounts on remote chains for advanced cross-chain governance and DeFi applications.
  </Card>

## Key Concepts

Understanding IBC's layered architecture:

  <Card title="Connections & Channels" icon="link">
    **Connections** establish identity verification between chains.
    **Channels** enable application-specific communication protocols built on connections.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Packets & Proofs" icon="shield">
    **Packets** carry data between chains with delivery guarantees.
    **Proofs** provide cryptographic verification of packet delivery and state changes.
  </Card>

## Relayers

Relayers are off-chain processes that facilitate IBC communication:

  <Card title="Monitoring" icon="eye">
    Continuously watch for new packets and state changes on connected blockchains.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Proof Submission" icon="upload">
    Submit cryptographic proofs to destination chains to complete packet delivery.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Timeout Handling" icon="clock">
    Handle packet timeouts and acknowledgments to ensure reliable communication.
  </Card>
